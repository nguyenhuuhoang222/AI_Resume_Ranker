Model Governance Systems Feb - Feb Java Developer Project Sales Record Application Description The project was designed to retrieve the customer and their vehicles information easily and effectively using Search module, the information then can be utilized for service records. The project had also a provision to allow adding the records of the new vehicle that was sold by the company to a new customer. It was developed in Java with database connectivity and used Oracle as database. It serves as good user interface where user can enter the name and details in textbox designed in swing and that information then stored in database. Responsibilities Designed the application based on the architecture of the MVC design pattern. Project was developed following Agile and Scrum methodologies. Requirement Analysis and Documentation as per SDLC methodologies. Converted requirement into flow design diagram using MS Visio. Performed data loading using spring - Hibernate. Used WSDL to post the services in the UDDI. Configured Hibernate s second level cache using EHCache to reduce the number of hits to the configuration table data. Developed views for JSP pages using AJAX Extensively used Hibernate in data access layer to access and update information in the database. Code development using Eclipse, HTML, JAVA, JSP, SWING, Servlet and SQL Created Functional Test cases and achieved bug fixes. Wrote SQL, PL SQL Procedures Functions Packages Triggers to handle business functionality. Used XML SAX parser to simulate xml file which has simulated test data. Code review and function testing for better client interface and usability.
