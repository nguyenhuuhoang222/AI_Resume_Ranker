  "raw_text": "Lorenzo Zackery / myvt.me@gmail.com /​215 . 980 . 1011\nProfile\nI've been a WordPress Developer for 13 years now. I've worked with big name marketing agencies in midtown Manhattan as well as Philadelphia. I’ve had clients from New York down to Atlanta all the way to Chicago to San Francisco. My biggest project to date was for IBM with a budget of $100 million. I’ve also flexed my remote capabilities by taking on an international client for a startup based in Tokyo which is a 13hr time difference. I'm more than capable of taking on any WordPress role as I’m a proven WP developer who specializes in Full Stacks (FE/BE), Site/Database Migrations, Theme/Plugin Configurations, PSD to HTML and every WordPress task in between. I simply love WordPress and I am deeply rooted in the WordPress online community.\nCore Qualifications\nWordPress theme / plugin development & configuration\nECommerce based sites\nFull stack / front end / backend\nPSD files to HTML theme development Wordpress migrations\nWordpress site updates and modifications\nTechnical Expertise\nWordPress HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, MySQL\nPortfolio (more available upon request)\nLendkey (Customers)\nhttp://www.lendkey.com/\nLendkey (Investors)\nhttps://business.lendkey.com/\nJews For Jesus\neShip Global\nhttps://study.eshipglobal.com/\nVarious WordPress Consulting Projects\t2005 - Present\nConsulted for companies independently, as well as through agencies such as Mondo & Robert\nHalf (references available). Projects range from full stacks, frontend, backend, wordpress migrations, theme/plugin configurations, PSD to html. Biggest project to date was Burlington Coat Factory (one million dollar budget) Worked in teams consisting of project managers, graphic designers, marketing directors, social media directors, IT managers, VP’s, CTO’s, CFO’s, CEO’s and owners. Worked remotely in all 4 continental time zones as well as one international time zone (Tokyo). Worked on personal Wordpress Projects (contracted youtuber) that have reached traffic upwards of 100k monthly visitors with an A from Google analytics within 10 months of launching. Built a free music streaming service consisting of social media, spotify and youtube API’s. Used by thousand of users a day.\nMost Recent WordPress Contracts\n***Due to confidentiality agreements, for me to give details for some of my past work I am legally unable to provide some company names. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\nWEG\tChicago, IL, USA\tJuly 2017 - March 2017\nThis contract role was a full stack role for a corporate staffing agency.

The $100 million government project was to revamp Cook County’s internal website. Cook county is the 2nd biggest county (after LA county in California) in the United States. A little over 24,000 employees are planned to use this site on a daily basis for all various types of county tasks & jobs.

This migration consisted of almost 10k articles (files) that were mis categorized by a failed attempt to migrate the site properly before I joined the project. I have a system of contingency plans when I start a migration that allows me to place 3 completely different fail safes simultaneously during my site migrations so EVERY file is accounted for. The migration also included 3rd party files such as mailchimp, application forms, contact forms and a woocommerce shop. Instead of restarting the migration (what the client had feared), I was able to patch up old errors, fix over 9k misdirected URL’s and properly set misshaped images to their original dimensions.\nLendKey\tManhattan, NY USA\tJuly 2016 - September 2016\nFinancial Tech company with over $1 billion worth of loans.
